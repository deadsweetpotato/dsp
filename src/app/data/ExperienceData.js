  p1: "Though I’m currently on a gap year (May ‘24 - Aug ‘25), I’m a student at Georgetown University working on my B.Sc. in Computer Science and minors in Cognitive Science and Science, Technology, and International Affairs (STIA). There, I’ve honed my skills in advanced programming, data structures, and user-focused product development. From redesigning scalable React applications to leading high-impact projects for clients through Georgetown’s premier software development club, I thrive at the intersection of technology, design, and collaboration.",
  p2: "Outside the classroom, I’ve built full-stack applications, led cross-functional teams, and shaped product strategies to bring innovative ideas to life. Whether it’s crafting scalable platforms with React and Firebase or designing intuitive interfaces and data-driven models, I thrive on solving complex problems where technology and design meet.",
  p3: "There’s still so much to learn, but here’s a little of how far I’ve come since I’ve started:"
