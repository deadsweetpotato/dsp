  p1: "Though I’m currently on a gap year (May ‘24 - Aug ‘25), I’m a student at Georgetown University working on my B.Sc. in Computer Science and minor in Cognitive Science. There, I’ve honed my skills in advanced programming, data structures, and user-focused product development. From redesigning scalable React applications to leading high-impact projects for clients through Georgetown’s premier software development club, I thrive at the intersection of technology, design, and collaboration.",
  p2: "Outside the classroom, I’ve built full-stack applications, led cross-functional teams, and shaped product strategies to bring innovative ideas to life. Whether it’s crafting scalable platforms with React and Firebase or designing intuitive interfaces and data-driven models, I thrive on solving complex problems where technology and design meet.",
  p3: "There’s still so much to learn, but here’s a little of how far I’ve come since I’ve started:"
